Introduction
The exponential growth in data production has necessitated efficient methods to process and condense information. Text summarization, an essential task in NLP, condenses text into its most crucial points, reducing information overload.

Summarization Techniques:
Abstractive: Rephrases content in new words.
Extractive: Extracts key phrases directly from the text.
LLMs like Gemma have significantly advanced summarization capabilities, achieving higher quality outputs.

Key Challenges:
Quality: Summaries vary based on target audience and purpose.
Hallucinations: LLMs may generate plausible but incorrect content.
Context Window Limits: Long texts require strategies to fit within model constraints.
Aim of the Project
This project demonstrates text summarization using Gemma with the following objectives:

Building a summarization pipeline using Gemma and LangChain.
Exploring techniques such as Stuffing, MapReduce, and Refine.
Fine-tuning Gemma using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT).
Proposing future enhancements for improved summarization.
Setup and Important Aspects
Building Blocks:
Gemma 2B: Lightweight and GPU-compatible.
HuggingFace: User-friendly NLP library.
LangChain: Constructs pipelines for large-document summarization.
Key Libraries Used:
PyTorch
HuggingFace Transformers
LangChain
PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
NumPy, Pandas
Evaluate, Datasets
Others (see notebook for complete list).
Methods and Strategies
The notebook explores three key summarization techniques:

Stuffing: Combines all input into one prompt.
MapReduce: Summarizes smaller chunks and combines results.
Refine: Iteratively enhances the summary.
How to Use
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Load your dataset and configure pipeline parameters, such as max_new_tokens and precision.
Run the notebook to generate summaries for your data.
Fine-Tuning
The notebook includes an example of fine-tuning Gemma using LoRa (PEFT), enabling model adaptation to specific datasets.

Conclusions and Next Steps
Future work could include:

Integrating more evaluation metrics like ROUGE.
Addressing hallucinations in LLM outputs.
Tailoring summarization pipelines for domain-specific applications.
